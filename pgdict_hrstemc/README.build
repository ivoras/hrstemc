Tested with PostgreSQL 9.5 on Ubuntu 16.04.4

* Install PostgreSQL development libraries, e.g. `postgresql-server-dev-9.5`
* Run `make USE_PGXS=1` in this directory to build the extension
* Run `sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install` to install the extension

Trying it out:

* Create a database, and connect to it with `psql` as a superuser
* Run `CREATE EXTENSION dict_hrstemc;` in the database. The dictionary is named `hrstemc`.
* Use it, e.g. `SELECT ts_lexize('hrstemc', 'izvukli');`
