Croatian stemmer for PostgreSQL
===============================

This module is a special case stemmer for the Croatian language, based on
the work at http://nlp.ffzg.hr/resources/tools/stemmer-for-croatian/ .

It may produce invalid roots, but this is deemed to be much better than
no stemming at all.

See the documentation in README.build for building and installing it.
